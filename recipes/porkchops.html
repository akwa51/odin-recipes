        <hr>
        <p>This quick, one-pan recipe is bursting with flavor and is perfect for a light summer dinner, The pork is well seasoned and the flavor is amplified through the caramelization that occurs during searing. 
            The bright acidity is balanced out with salty, brininess from the topping of olives and feta cheese. Nicole likes to use a non-stick pan to make this recipe because it takes less oil to get a good sear. 
            Boneless pork chops are your best choice here because you'll pound out the chops to a ½-inch thickness so they'll cook quickly and evenly.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>For chicken breasts: use 3 breasts, sliced horizontally in half. Sear breast fillets on each side until golden and cooked through (about 6 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of your fillets). Continue directions from the sauce, onwards.</li>
                <li>For oven baked, bone-in thighs: Preheat oven at 400°F or 200°C. Sear chicken in an oven proof skillet or pan, skin side down first for 3 minutes.</li>  
                <li>Flip and sear for a further 3 minutes until browned each side. Then bake in the oven for a further 20-25 minutes, 
                until completely cooked through and no longer pink inside. Continue directions from the sauce, onwards. </li>
